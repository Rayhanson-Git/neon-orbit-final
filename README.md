# Neon Orbit Arcade

**MTEC 1201 – Final Project**  
**By: Harvey Chowdhury**

Neon Orbit Arcade is an interactive, calm, neon-themed web experience built with p5.js.  
The project explores motion, light, and subtle interaction through particles, portals, and ambient visuals.

The experience is intentionally minimal and meditative, allowing the user to create evolving compositions by simply moving and interacting with the mouse.

## Concepts Used (Course Requirements)

This project includes all required concepts from the second half of the semester:

- **Loops** – used to update and render multiple visual systems every frame  
- **Arrays** – used to store and manage particles, rings, portals, and background stars  
- **Classes (Object-Oriented Programming)** – custom classes such as `Particle`, `Ring`, `Portal`, and `Star` define behavior and structure

## How to Interact

- **Move mouse** – control the central orb  
- **Hold mouse** – emit calm particles  
- **Click** – place a portal (maximum of 6)  
- **1** – Calm mode  
- **2** – Chaos mode  
- **C** – Clear particles and rings
